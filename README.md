## Database

We are currently working with the MIT SIPB MySQL Database service, which allows 100MB of total storage for free.
The following is the instruction for accessing the database through MIT SIPBâ€™s webpage that you can use to add or drop entire databases:

1. Open http://sql.mit.edu/main/do/index
2. Around the top right corner of the page, there are two choices for logging-in, choose the SQL Password option.
3. Enter the username (mit-ps) and password (cut18vuk).
4. You should see something like the following if you did everything right.

To interact with a specific database, it is suggested that we should use phpMyAdmin, and to do that, you open the following link.
https://sql.scripts.mit.edu/phpMyAdmin/index.php?db=&table=&server=1&target=&token=c5b17600b2fb3b32e70c89903ec66b38
After that, you enter the same username and password.
