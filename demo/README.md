# Demo Instructions

Explanation on what each code does is contained within the Jupyter notebooks themselves. You must run the demo_openalex.ipynb and demo_nih.ipynb first, which uploads data from OpenAlex and NIH RePORTER, before running demo_delete.ipynb, which deletes the data uploaded from those first two scripts. Additionally, I suggest running or reading demo_openalex.ipynb first.
