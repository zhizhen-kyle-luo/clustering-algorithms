Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) will be used to measure interstitial glucose levels (in the tissue under the skin), which are similar to blood glucose levels. CGM is a small, minimally-invasive sensor worn on the thigh, which gives a glucose measurement every 5 minutes, and can help us understand changes in blood sugar levels without having to do a blood draw or fingerstick. CGM will be used during PN cycling for up to 30 days or until hospital discharge. CGM data will be hidden from the clinical team, there will be no change to routine clinical care. This study may help us understand how cycled PN affects glucose levels in infants with intestinal failure, which may help other children treated with cycled PN in the future.\n",

      "Detailed Description\n",
      "The objective of this investigation is to quantify dysglycemia associated with cycled parenteral nutrition (PN) and elevated glucose infusion rates (GIR) in infants with intestinal failure and PN-dependence, leveraging high-frequency continuous glucose monitor (CGM) sensor glucose values in a prospective, observational study.Intestinal failure is a malabsorptive state which necessitates PN in its most severe form. PN is ideally transitioned from continuous (24 hr/day) to cycled PN (<24 hr/day), requiring higher glucose infusion rates (GIR) to provide the same nutrition content over a shorter time-period. Patients on cycled PN, especially infants, are vulnerable to dysglycemia (abnormal glucose levels), specifically hyperglycemia during PN infusions (due to inadequate insulin relative to high GIR) and hypoglycemia when PN is cycled off (due to delayed insulin suppression after PN suspension). There is no established pediatric GIR threshold above which the risk of abnormal glucose levels significantly increases.While current practice relies on intermittent blood glucose checks, continuous glucose monitors (CGM) measure high-frequency glucose profiles via minimally-invasive sensors, and are capable of precisely detecting clinically-actionable trends that may otherwise go unrecognized. The CGM sensor measures interstitial glucose, an accepted proxy for blood glucose in patients > 2 years old with diabetes or glycemic variability. CGM has been successfully used in infants and can fulfill the need for greater quantitative insight into glucose trends in metabolically and neurologically fragile populations, including infants with intestinal failure.The investigators hypothesize that during high-GIR, cycled PN: a). trough glucose while PN is suspended is less than normal (statistically defined as 100 mg/dL), and b) average glucose while receiving the target (highest) GIR is greater than normal (statistically defined as 120 mg/dL).Eligible infants will be identified among hospitalized infants at Boston Children\\'s Hospital and followed by the Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) program and the Center for Advanced Intestinal Rehabilitation (CAIR). All enrolled participants will have a Dexcom G6 Pro CGM placed within 1 week prior to the anticipated initiation of PN cycling, and CGM will be worn using blinded mode for up to 30 days until target GIR cycled PN is reached (3 sensors maximum). No CGM will remain in place at the time of discharge. The CGM readings will remain blinded to the clinical staff members, no real-time CGM alerts will be provided to the clinical staff. The clinical team will manage PN cycling and clinical blood glucose monitoring as per routine clinical practice. Chart review will occur throughout the study period to abstract necessary information about the participant\\'s medical history and interval clinical events.An initial CGM data review will be conducted by the research team within 72 hours of each sensor removal. The clinical team will be notified if there were intervals meeting the criteria of sustained sensor readings < 50 mg/dL for greater than or equal to 15 minutes. The clinical team will be provided with the criteria for notification, the date/time stamps associated with those event(s), and information about interpreting CGM readings. We will provide this limited information to the clinical team because sustained CGM sensor readings < 50 mg/dL may signify that the participant is at increased risk for hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 mg/dL) on cycled PN.

      "Detailed Description\n",
      "Sepsis represents the most common cause of childhood mortality worldwide. In the United States alone, 200 cases of pediatric sepsis are diagnosed each day, with an associated hospital mortality rate of 5-10% and health care expenditures now approaching $5 billion annually. Moreover, nearly one third of children admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) for septic shock have not regained their baseline health-related quality of life one year following the sepsis event.During early resuscitation of the child with septic shock, in addition to antibiotics, volume replacement, and vasoactive-inotropic support, the most recent pediatric treatment guidelines advise the practitioner to consider adjunctive hydrocortisone therapy if the patient \"is at risk of absolute adrenal insufficiency or adrenal pituitary axis failure\". However, the potential benefits and risks of this recommendation have not been rigorously examined. On the one hand, corticosteroids are inexpensive and have been frequently demonstrated to improve hemodynamic status in children and adults with sepsis. Conversely, this drug class is known to alter transcription of approximately 30% of the human genome. Notably, corticosteroids down regulate most aspects of the immune response, but particularly adaptive immunity. Moreover, recent data suggests that children with particular gene expression profiles in sepsis have increased likelihood of mortality when treated with corticosteroids.SHIPSS (Stress Hydrocortisone In Pediatric Septic Shock) is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial examining the potential benefits and risks of adjunctive hydrocortisone prescribed to critically ill children with fluid and vasoactive-inotropic refractory septic shock. Up to 1,032 children will be enrolled, randomized, and evaluated at baseline, and 28 and 90 days following study enrollment.The primary hypothesis is that hydrocortisone, compared to placebo, will decrease the proportion of subjects with poor outcomes, defined as death or severely impaired (≥25% decrease from baseline) HRQL. Subjects will be monitored daily while receiving care in the PICU for the occurrence of adverse events, including the following protocol specified events:hyperglycemia treated with any insulin; gastrointestinal hemorrhage treated with blood product transfusion or vasopressin or octreotide infusion; delirium requiring medical treatment; and hospital-acquired infection treated with new antimicrobials. Finally, the investigators will test the hypothesis that biomarker-based prognostic and predictive enrichment strategies can improve our ability to identify which children with septic shock are more likely to benefit from adjunctive hydrocortisone, and which may be harmed. This trial will have a significant impact on public health by providing the heretofore missing evidence to inform guidelines regarding therapy for septic shock in children.The SHIPSS trial will enroll patients from PICUs in Canada, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Brazil, Vietnam, Pakistan, Japan, China, Malaysia, and Singapore. Health Canada approval is not required as hydrocortisone is approved for use in septic shock in children, and this trial meets the criteria of a Phase IV study. In the United States, this trial is considered a Phase III trial as hydrocortisone is approved for use in septic shock but not specifically approved for use in pediatric septic shock.', '[2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025]', '[{\"id\": \"4001\", \"name\": \"Clinical Medicine and Science\"}]', '[{\"id\": \"80003\", \"name\": \"32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences\"}, {\"id\": \"80013\", \"name\": \"42 Health Sciences\"}, {\"id\": \"80045\", \"name\": \"3202 Clinical Sciences\"}]', '[{\"id\": \"3901\", \"name\": \"Clinical\"}]', '[{\"id\": \"898\", \"name\": \"Infection\"}]', '[{\"id\": \"10601\", \"name\": \"6.1 Pharmaceuticals\"}]', '[{\"id\": \"546\", \"name\": \"Patient Safety\"}, {\"id\": \"507\", \"name\": \"Clinical Research\"}, {\"id\": \"475\", \"name\": \"Sepsis\"}, {\"id\": \"533\", \"name\": \"Infectious Diseases\"}, {\"id\": \"558\", \"name\": \"Prevention\"}, {\"id\": \"447\", \"name\": \"Hematology\"}, {\"id\": \"508\", \"name\": \"Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities\"}, {\"id\": \"547\", \"name\": \"Pediatric\"}]', '[\"Septic Shock\"]', 'All', 'NCT03401398', '[[\"J Zimmerman Jerry\", \"MD, PhD\", \"Principal Investigator\", \"Seattle Children\\'s Hospital, University of Washington School of Medicine\", \"University of Washington\", \"grid.34477.33\"], [\"Michael Agus\", \"MD\", \"Principal Investigator\", \"Boston Children\\'s Hospital, Harvard Medical School\", \"Boston Children\\'s Hospital\", \"grid.2515.3\"], [\"Hector R Wong\", \"MD\", \"Principal Investigator\", \"Children\\'s Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati\", \"Cincinnati Children\\'s Hospital Medical Center\", \"grid.239573.9\"], [\"David Wypij\", \"PhD\", \"Principal Investigator\", \"Boston Children\\'s Hospital, Harvard Medical School\", \"Boston Children\\'s Hospital\", \"grid.2515.3\"], [\"Kusum Menon\", \"MD, MSc\", \"Principal Investigator\", \"Children\\'s Hospital of Eastern Ontario\", \"Children\\'s Hospital of Eastern Ontario\", \"grid.414148.c\"], [\"Katri Typpo\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"University of Arizona Medical Centre\", \"University of Arizona\", \"grid.134563.6\"], [\"Christopher Newth\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"Children\\'s Hospital of Los Angeles\", \"Children\\'s Hospital of Los Angeles\", \"grid.239546.f\"], [\"Natalie Cvijanovich\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"UCSF Benioff Children\\'s Hospital - Oakland\", \"UCSF Benioff Children\\'s Hospital\", \"grid.414016.6\"], [\"Adam Schwarz\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"Children\\'s Hospital of Orange County\", \"Children\\'s Hospital of Orange County\", \"grid.414164.2\"], [\"Patrick McQuillen\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"UCSF Benioff Children\\'s Hospital - San Francisco\", \"UCSF Benioff Children\\'s Hospital\", \"grid.414016.6\"], [\"Catherine Madurski\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"Nemours Children\\'s Health\"], [\"Asumthia Jeyapalan\", \"DO\", \"Contact\", \"University of Miami Hospital\", \"University of Miami Hospital\", \"grid.413057.4\"], [\"Michael Nares\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"University of Miami Hospital\", \"University of Miami Hospital\", \"grid.413057.4\"], [\"Grace Chong\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"University of Chicago, Comer Children\\'s Hospital\", \"Comer Children\\'s Hospital\", \"grid.428125.8\"], [\"Sandeep Tripath\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"The University of Illinois at Chicago/OSF Children\\'s Hospital of Illinois\", \"University of Illinois at Chicago\", \"grid.185648.6\"], [\"John Berkenbosch\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"University of Louisville, Norton Children\\'s Hospital\", \"University of Louisville\", \"grid.266623.5\"], [\"Ana Lia Granciano\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"University of Maryland Medical Center\", \"University of Maryland Medical Center\", \"grid.413036.3\"], [\"Shira J Gertz\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"Saint Barnabas Medical Center\", \"Saint Barnabas Medical Center\", \"grid.416350.5\"], [\"Ranjit R Chima\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"Cincinnati Children\\'s Hospital Medical Center\", \"Cincinnati Children\\'s Hospital Medical Center\", \"grid.239573.9\"], [\"Christine Allen\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"The Children\\'s Hospital at Oklahoma University Medical Center\", \"Children\\'s Hospital of Oklahoma\", \"grid.470168.c\"], [\"Robert Kavanagh\", \"MD\", \"Contact\", \"Penn State Milton S.

To see if using CGMs helps us prevent low blood glucose levels and allows us to find a diagnosis and treat sooner, we will randomize patients into one of two groups: a \"CGM group\" where the CGM information is made available to the NICU team and a \"Standard of Care\" group where the CGM information will only be available to the research team.

      "We aim to evaluate the utility of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) in improving the diagnosis and management of neonatal hypoglycemia in infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Specifically, we hope to assess whether the use of CGMs in this population reduces the number and severity of hypoglycemic events, reduces the time to diagnosis of the etiology of hypoglycemia and/or reduces the time taken to achieve stable euglycemia on a sustainable feeding regimen. We plan to perform a prospective pilot and feasibility study comparing the clinical course and outcomes of newborns with hypoglycemia admitted to the NICU who are actively monitored with CGMs versus those who receive routine care. Eligible infants will be late preterm and term infants admitted to the Boston Children\\'s Hospital who have had two documented hypoglycemic episodes during their current admission. Families will be approached for consent shortly after diagnosis of recurrent hypoglycemia. As all of these infants will be undergoing periodic blood glucose monitoring as part of their routine care, enrollment in this study will involve minimal additional interventions, including CGM placement, which involves placement of a small subcutaneous needle sensor, and the possibility of drawing additional blood glucose samples if hypoglycemia is detected by CGM. All enrolled infants will be placed on a CGM monitor and then randomized to either the \"CGM Protocol\" or \"Standard of Care\" group. Those on the CGM Protocol will have a fully accessible CGM that will be analyzed for blood glucose trends and will alarm for any blood glucose level approaching hypoglycemic threshold (eg. BG <70 mg/dL). Those in the \"Standard of Care\" group will have a CGM in place, but values will not be available to the clinical team except if severe hypoglycemia is recorded (eg. BG <40 mg/dL). Whenever the CGM alarms or there is a concerning blood glucose trend as measured by the CGM, the nurse will be asked to check a blood glucose value. All clinical management decisions will be made by the clinical team based on confirmed blood glucose values. In the control group, the only change to current management is the potential performance of additional blood glucose checks that may be prompted by CGM alarms for severe hypoglycemia. The CGM will remain in place until the infant is no longer being monitored for glycemic stability or the infant is discharged. We will record all blood glucose levels, laboratory data related to investigation of the underlying cause of hypoglycemia, all intravenous and enteral sources of glucose, and uses of other therapeutic interventions such as diazoxide and carnitine replacement. We will also compare blood glucose data with information from the CGM monitors to assess accuracy.

      "Because glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) has been shown to reflect average glycemia over several months and has a strong predictive value for diabetes complications, routine quarterly measurements is a standard of care in children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. The A1c value determines whether the patient\\'s glycemic targets have been reached or maintained. The availability of the A1c result at the time the patient is seen (point-of-care testing) has been reported in adults with diabetes to result in increased intensification of therapy and improvement in glycemic control in type 1 and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and in type 2 diabetes. The A1c may also serve as a check on the accuracy of the patient\\'s glucose meter and the validity of the patient\\'s reported self monitored blood glucose (SMBG) results.In many clinical settings, A1c is determined in a central laboratory on a blood sample obtained by venipuncture and results usually are available one to two business days after the sample is obtained. If the A1c value is different than predicted from a review of available SMBG data at the visit, the practitioner must contact the family to review the results and, revise any care decisions made during the visit. This system is inefficient and fraught with the potential for less than optimal care relating to delays in the practitioner seeing the result, delays in reaching the subject or parents, and absence of the subject\\'s participation in the phone call updating the care plan. Furthermore, many children dread venipuncture, which is often poorly tolerated and makes clinic visits painful, emotionally traumatic and unpleasant experiences.Because there are no published data on the utility of point-of-care A1c testing in children and adolescents with diabetes, we designed a prospective randomized controlled trial to determine if subjects who received immediate feedback of A1c results at their clinic visits would have a lower A1c as compared to those who received A1c results after the clinic visit. We intend to determine whether immediate feedback of A1c results will enable the clinicians providing diabetes care to make more adjustments to the subject\\'s management plan at the time of the clinic visit, and whether this will lead to fewer communications with the subject/family between visits. Finally we will assess the relative pain caused by fingerstick blood sampling as compared to venipuncture.', '[2003, 2004, 2005, 2006]', '[{\"id\": \"4001\", \"name\": \"Clinical Medicine and Science\"}]', '[{\"id\": \"80003\", \"name\": \"32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences\"}, {\"id\": \"80045\", \"name\": \"3202 Clinical Sciences\"}]', '[{\"id\": \"906\", \"name\": \"Metabolic and endocrine\"}]', '[{\"id\": \"438\", \"name\": \"Diabetes\"}, {\"id\": \"496\", \"name\": \"Autoimmune Disease\"}, {\"id\": \"507\", \"name\": \"Clinical Research\"}]', '[\"Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus\", \"Glycemic Control\"]', 'All', 'NCT00898534', '[[\"Michael SD Agus\", \"MD\", \"Principal Investigator\", \"Boston Children\\'s Hospital\", \"Boston Children\\'s Hospital\", \"grid.2515.3\"]]', 'https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00898534', 'Phase 4', 'ClinicalTrials.gov', '[\"{\\\"type\\\": \\\"Experimental\\\", \\\"label\\\": \\\"Immediate Feedback\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Subjects receive point-of-care hemoglobin A1c testing prior to their diabetes clinic visit, with results made available to the provider during the visit.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"type\\\": \\\"No Intervention\\\", \\\"label\\\": \\\"Conventional Feedback\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Subjects receive laboratory hemoglobin A1c testing at the clinic visit, with results made available to the provider several days later.\\\"}\"]', '[\"{\\\"allocation\\\": \\\"Randomized\\\", \\\"intervention_model\\\": \\\"Parallel Assignment\\\", \\\"primary_purpose\\\": \\\"Treatment\\\", \\\"masking\\\": \\\"None (Open Label)\\\"}\"]', 'Inclusion Criteria: Type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at least 2 years prior to enrollment in study Less than 18 years of age Exclusion Criteria: Cystic fibrosis related diabetes Type 2 diabetes Any other suspected non-type 1 diabetes (e.g., maturity onset diabetes of the young)', '18 Years', '2 Years', '[{\"measure\": \"Hemoglobin A1c\", \"time_frame\": \"1 year after enrollment\", \"type\": \"primary\"}, {\"measure\": \"Hemoglobin A1c\", \"time_frame\": \"3, 6, and 9 months after enrollment\", \"type\": \"secondary\"}, {\"measure\": \"Pain rating of hemoglobin A1c test\", \"time_frame\": \"3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment\", \"type\": \"secondary\"}, {\"measure\": \"Change in diabetes management (insulin, diet, exercise, glucose self-monitoring)\", \"time_frame\": \"3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment\", \"type\": \"secondary\"}, {\"measure\": \"Episodes of severe hypoglycemia\", \"time_frame\": \"3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment\", \"type\": \"secondary\"}, {\"measure\": \"Hospital admissions for diabetes related event\", \"time_frame\": \"3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment\", \"type\": \"secondary\"}, {\"measure\": \"Number of phone and/or email contacts between practitioner and patient\", \"time_frame\": \"3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment\", \"type\": \"secondary\"}]', '234', 'Interventional', 'Effect of Immediate Hemoglobin A1c on Glycemic Control in Children With Type I Diabetes Mellitus');\n",

      "Detailed Description\n",
      "Children undergoing heart surgery are under significant bodily stress, which can lead to higher than normal or lower than normal blood glucose levels. A synthetic form of insulin, a naturally occurring hormone in the body, can be injected into people to normalize blood glucose levels. Insulin is most commonly used to treat people with diabetes, but it is also used in hospitals to control blood glucose levels in patients. Previous studies of adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients have shown that patients whose blood sugar levels are maintained at normal levels with the use of insulin contract fewer infections and are released more quickly from the ICU than patients who do not maintain normal blood glucose levels. This study will use a continuous blood glucose monitoring system to detect changes in blood glucose levels. Intravenous insulin infusions will be used to then safely maintain normal blood glucose levels. The purpose of this study is to determine if maintaining normal blood glucose levels during an ICU stay will help decrease the incidence of infections and improve surgical recovery in young children following heart surgery.This study will enroll children who are undergoing heart surgery that requires a cardiopulmonary bypass procedure. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a control group or the treatment group. All participants will receive usual care while in the ICU and will undergo continuous glucose monitoring. Participants in the treatment group will receive intravenous insulin infusions to keep their blood glucose within the normal range. While in the ICU, blood will be collected from all participants once a day for the first 3 days and then once a week to monitor glucose levels, hormone levels, and measurements of nutrition and immune function. On days 1 and 5 following surgery, participants who are on a ventilator will have their breath measured to monitor heart function and energy use. Thirty days and 1 year following surgery, study researchers will contact the participant\\'s parent or doctor to collect information on health status and any new infections at the surgical site. Children who enroll in the study will be asked to participate in follow-up neurodevelopmental evaluations at 1 and 3 years of age to assess longer term cognitive effects of tight glycemic control in the ICU.', '[2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014]', '[{\"id\": \"4001\", \"name\": \"Clinical Medicine and Science\"}]', '[{\"id\": \"80003\", \"name\": \"32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences\"}, {\"id\": \"80045\", \"name\": \"3202 Clinical Sciences\"}]', '[{\"id\": \"3901\", \"name\": \"Clinical\"}]', '[{\"id\": \"906\", \"name\": \"Metabolic and endocrine\"}]', '[{\"id\": \"331\", \"name\": \"Cardiovascular\"}, {\"id\": \"445\", \"name\": \"Heart Disease\"}, {\"id\": \"438\", \"name\": \"Diabetes\"}, {\"id\": \"508\", \"name\": \"Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities\"}, {\"id\": \"507\", \"name\": \"Clinical Research\"}, {\"id\": \"546\", \"name\": \"Patient Safety\"}, {\"id\": \"558\", \"name\": \"Prevention\"}, {\"id\": \"547\", \"name\": \"Pediatric\"}]', '[\"Heart Defects, Congenital\", \"Hyperglycemia\"]', 'All', 'NCT00443599', '[[\"Michael Agus\", \"MD\", \"Principal Investigator\", \"Boston Children\\'s Hospital\", \"Boston Children\\'s Hospital\", \"grid.2515.3\"]]', 'https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00443599', 'N/A', 'ClinicalTrials.gov', '[\"{\\\"type\\\": \\\"Experimental\\\", \\\"label\\\": \\\"Insulin\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Insulin was infused to target a blood glucose concentration of 80-110 mg/dL\\\"}\", \"{\\\"type\\\": \\\"Active Comparator\\\", \\\"label\\\": \\\"Usual Care\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Insulin was infused according to the discretion of the treating clinical team.\\\"}\"]', '[\"{\\\"allocation\\\": \\\"Randomized\\\", \\\"intervention_model\\\": \\\"Parallel Assignment\\\", \\\"primary_purpose\\\": \\\"Treatment\\\", \\\"masking\\\": \\\"None (Open Label)\\\"}\"]', 'Inclusion Criteria: Undergoing heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass Recovering in the Cardiac ICU Exclusion Criteria: Enrolled in another interventional clinical trial with related study outcomes', '36 Months', 'N/A', '[{\"description\": \"Nosocomial infections that are attributable to the subject\\'s stay in the Cardiac ICU, according to Center for Disease Control-defined criteria.
